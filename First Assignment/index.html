        <b> <i> HELLO! </i> </b> 
        and welcome to my profile! My name is Muhammad Ashar, I am currently pursuing bachelors
        in computer science from SMI University. My passion for technology led me to pursue a web and mobile 
        application development course, where I gained knowledge and experience in HTML, CSS, 
        JavaScript, and ReactJS. In addition to my technical skills, I have strong command over 
        written and spoken english. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently, I am actively seeking opportunities in the industry where I can learn and polish 
        my skills. I am confident in my abilities to adapt to new 
        challenges and to work collaboratively with a team to achieve common goals.
        Thank you for visiting my profile, and I look forward to connecting with you!
